test problem following Perfect Art interview
- version 2 (after making corrections consistent with received comments)


everything important happens in mctask2.py

plotting is done in mcplot2.py, after all samples are generated in mctask.py

jtrans.py performs an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation on the results, and plots resulting normal-like and uniform-like distributions

bestfit.py is a brute-force distribution finding tool that I borrowed from stackoverflow and did not comment

everything else is inconsequential

new change
